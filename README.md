# selection-sort in c
this repository contains a c programs that impliments selection sort algorithm.
this algorithm works as repeatedly find the min element in unsorted part of array and put at it's right place in array.
selection sort is inplace sorting. so it's space complexity is O(1)

ALGORITHM STEPS :
1. starts with very first element.
2. find the minimum one in unsorted array.
3. swap it with the first element.
4. move to the next position.
5. repeat until the array is sorted.

TIME COMPLEXITY :
best case -> 0(n^2)
average case -> 0(n^2)
worst case -> 0(n^2)
